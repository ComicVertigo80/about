# About Me

### Creating, laughing and coding along

Nicole H. would describe herself as just a funny lady (the mayor of silly goose town (soon to be state rep) and sometimes dungeon master —no, not that kind),
but we’d have to remind her she’s also a—
writer, podcast host, and founder of VertigoVentures LLC,
a heart-led initiative devoted to community connection, creative storytelling, and accessible tech.

She’s the mind behind the upcoming Creative Question podcast,
the curator of the Curiously, Yours newsletter,
and the architect of Tiny Moments—
a queer community project mapping moments of meaning across Western Massachusetts.

Nicole also builds digital tools like EventList,
a Chrome extension currently in beta
that lets users view Facebook events in a minimalist fashion—
designed to increase connection through accessibility.

She is a graduate of the 1Berkshire Leadership Program,
and holds professional certifications in IT and cybersecurity from Google and IBM,
as well as certificates in Business Fundamentals from Wharton
and Computational Thinking from the University of Pennsylvania.

She’s been credited as a producer of two queer indie short films
and is currently working on three books:
— a children’s story,
— a poetry collection,
— and a cozy lesbian mystery,
all aiming to launch around 2028.

But more than her titles or projects,
Nicole is a builder of spaces where people feel seen.

She believes in magic.
In kindness.
In small rituals that tether us to something bigger.
And in the quiet power of showing up every day—even when it’s hard.

Through heartbreak, healing, humor, and hope,
she works to remind others of the beauty all around us.

What is truly meant for us will never miss.
And we get to make space for it every single day.

She hopes you find not only space for your story to share,
but also peace and joy, too.
